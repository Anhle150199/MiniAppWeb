## What is a URL Slug and Why is it Important for SEO?

A **URL slug** is the part of a web address that appears after the main domain and points to a specific page on your website. For example, in the URL `https://example.com/ultimate-guide-to-gardening`, the slug is "ultimate-guide-to-gardening." A well-optimized, **SEO-friendly URL slug** can improve your page’s SEO by making it more understandable for search engines and more readable for users. Creating short, descriptive **URL slugs** also enhances user experience, making the links more relevant and likely to be clicked.

### Examples of SEO-Friendly URL Slugs

- **How to Start a Vegetable Garden** → `how-to-start-a-vegetable-garden`
- **Top 10 Tips for Healthy Skin** → `top-10-tips-for-healthy-skin`
- **Beginner’s Guide to Yoga** → `beginners-guide-to-yoga`
- **Essential Photography Equipment for Beginners** → `essential-photography-equipment-for-beginners`
- **Easy Recipes for Busy Weeknights** → `easy-recipes-for-busy-weeknights`

By using short, meaningful slugs, you help create **SEO-friendly URLs** that are not only easier to share but also improve your website's visibility on search engines.
